## RAG and PDF Handling

This project uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to handle queries over multiple PDF documents. When users ask questions, the chatbot retrieves relevant information from the PDFs and generates accurate responses based on the combined context. This makes the chatbot effective for handling a large corpus of sustainability-related documents and offering informed answers.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/rasika1205/Sustainability-Chatbot.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Sustainability-Chatbot
   ```
3. (Optional) Set up a Python virtual environment.

4. Install any required Python dependencies (if specified in a `requirements.txt` file):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the chatbot locally, execute the Python backend (typically `app.py`). For example:
```
python app.py
```
Then, open the HTML interface in your web browser.
